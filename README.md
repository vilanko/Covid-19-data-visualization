Problem Description: Predicting COVID-19 Case Surges for Public Health Preparedness 
The problem at hand involves using the COVID-19 dataset to predict potential surges 
in new cases and deaths due to the virus.

Target Values:
● New Cases
● New Deaths
Relevant Columns:
● Date of Observation
● Cumulative Cases
● Cumulative Deaths


The dataset I have chosen is the "COVID-19 Global Pandemic Data." 
This dataset is maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO) and
various governmental health agencies around the world.
